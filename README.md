Using a detailed dataset of house sale transactions in Ames, Iowa, this research compares the
predictive power of four analytical methods (deep neural networks, principal component
regression, support vector regression and regression trees). Results show that the deep
neural network approach is the most effective for predicting house prices. The deep
neural network also performs better with large amounts of data compared to other
machine learning algorithms.
